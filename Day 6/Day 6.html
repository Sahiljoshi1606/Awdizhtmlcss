                        <h2>Traffic management system</h2>
                        <p> A traffic management system is a planning of placing traffic lighting, signage and guarding
                            on the carriageway that meets all the standards laid out in chapter 8 of the industryâ€™s code
                            of practice. It is a key branch within logistics that concerns the planning, control and
                            purchasing of transport services needed to physically move vehicles and freight. The Traffic
                            Management System aims to provide motorists with a faster, safer trip on metro area freeways
                            by optimizing the use of available freeway capacity, efficiently managing incidents and
                            special events, providing traveler information, and providing incentives for ride sharing.
                            Smart Traffic Management Systems are technology solutions that municipalities can integrate
                            into their traffic cabinets and intersections today for fast, cost-effective improvements in
                            safety and traffic flow on their city streets.</p>

                        <p>Lathe machine is probably the oldest machine tool know to mankind. Its first use dates back
                            to
                            1300 BC in Egypt. The first lathe was a simple Lathe which is now called a two-person lathe.

                            In this one person would turn the wood workpiece using rope and the other person would shape
                            the
                            workpiece using a sharp tool.

                            This design was further improved by the Ancient Romans who added the turning bow and lather
                            the
                            paddle (as there in the sewing machine) was added.

                            Further during the industrial revolution Steam Engines and water wheel were attached to the
                            Lathe to turn the workpiece to a higher speed which made the work faster and easier.

                            Then in 1950 servo mechanism was used to control the lathe machine.

                            From this crude begging and over a period of more than two centuries, the modern engine
                            lathe
                            has evolved. Now we have the most advanced form of the Lathe Machine which is the CNC Lathe
                            Machine.

                            HENRY MAUDSLAY, a British Engineer is considered as the inventor of the metal lathe.</p>
