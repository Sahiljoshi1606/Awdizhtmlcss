    <p style="line-height: 50px; text-align: justify; letter-spacing: 5px;"> Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their
        architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external
        environment. In the upcoming years, IoT-based technology will offer advanced levels of services and practically
        change the way people lead their daily lives. Advancements in medicine, power, gene therapies, agriculture,
        smart cities, and smart homes are just a few of the categorical examples where IoT is strongly established.

        IOT is a system of interrelated things, computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or
        people that are provided with unique identifiers. And the ability to transfer the data over a network requiring
        human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.</p>
